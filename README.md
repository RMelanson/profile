# Purpose:      Bootstaps is a simplified installation package for many
#               linux packages.
#
# Description:  Bootstraps is a master bootstrap utility for downloading and
#               installing multiple software bootstraps for initialization.
#               Additionally, the bootstraps may be run after the linux system
#               has been installed.
#               The masterBootstrap.sh is used to download all the bootstraps
#               from the git repository for future potential installation.
#
# Installation: Execute the masterBootstrap.sh, upon installation of a new
#               Linux installation as a bootstrap or as a stand alone bash
#               script.
#               If executing the script manually on a linux os after
#               downloading from the git repository, be sure to:
#               1) execute as root
#                  ./masterBootstrap.sh
#               2) or as user with sudo access:
#                  sudo ./masterBootstrap.sh
